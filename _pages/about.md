Welcome to Fatima Jinnah Women University's **Speech and Language Processing Group (SLPG)**. We develop computational models for the understanding or generation of natural language. Some of our current areas of interest are:

* Universal natural language processing and transfer learning
* Natural language processing for educational applications
* Context-aware machine translation
* Low-resource machine translation

More details about our project can be found [here](https://slpg-fjwu.github.io/graduate_research/). Also check out the our latest publications and participation in [WMT](http://www2.statmt.org/wmt23/) workshops.
