We are thrilled to announce a remarkable accomplishment within our Speech & Language Processing Group (SLPG) that fills us with immense pride. 🏆 One of our talented students has secured the coveted Merit Award at the prestigious NUST 3 Minute Thesis Competition!

Sami Ul Haq, our dedicated student's exceptional presentation and research skills shone brightly during the competition, earning him the well-deserved Merit Award. This achievement not only reflects his dedication to research excellence but also their ability to effectively communicate complex ideas in just three minutes. He is working on building Context-Aware Neural Machine Translation systems for low-resourced langauges. 

Stay tuned for more updates on our group's achievements and advancements. Together, we forge ahead toward new heights of success!
